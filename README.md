## How my project will work in real-time:

- User uploads an article / claim / text.
- Langchain checks it against trusted news sources.
- Fact-checking APIs verify claims dynamically.
- AI provides a confidence score and fake/real verdict.

## âœ… What Does the Google Fact Check API Do?
The Google Fact Check API scans a large database of fact-checked claims from verified sources like:

- PolitiFact
- Snopes
- FactCheck.org
- Reuters Fact Check
- AP Fact Check, etc.

When a user enters a claim, the API searches for matching or similar claims that have already been fact-checked by these organizations.
